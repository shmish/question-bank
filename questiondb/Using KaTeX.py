To enter math text into the text editor, put your text in between dollar signs.

To do a subscript, use the _ key.  $$ v_o $$

To do exponents, use the ^ key.  $$ x^2 $$

To have multiple symbols/digits/letters put them inside curly braces.

Here is an example of more complex exponents and subscripts: $$ v_{everything} + x^{allthis} $$

To use the X times symbol use \times:  $$ 1.6 \times 10^{-19} $$

To use fractions use \frac{numerator}{denominator}.

Spaces use \space. Eg: \frac{up \space top}{no space}
$$ \frac{up \space top}{no space} $$

Vectors are done with \vec .  Example for Fnet: $$ \vec{F}_{net} $$

Theta is \theta , delta is \Delta
$$ sin\theta = 0.5 $$

Here is an example equation for distance in kinematics:
$$ \overrightarrow{\Delta x} = v_o t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
